This project ia about creating Tokenizer for a Lexer my friend is building.
I am creating a Tokenizer in Java language.
I am learing Java by doing this project. I am kind of a beginner in Java.

This is in master branch. There was a main branch but only with a Readme file. I deleted that main branch.
So there is only master branch now with this new Readme file.

I may need to create new branches while developing this project further.

I created two more branches.
In branch "lexercode", i updated code of lexer.java file.
In branch "thirdbranch", I updated remaining code and we can run this project.

To run, in terminal, we need these command,
javac lexer/*.java lexer/core/*.java util/*.java ; java lexer.Main
